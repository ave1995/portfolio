# Intro

I am based in the Czech Republic and currently work remotely as a software developer for Dataprojekt. In the company I use technologies like ASP.NET Core, Razor Pages, Javascript, jQuery, Boostrap, SQL and so on. However, I tend to learn and use the best technologies and approaches that will best solve the problem at hand. That's why I'm now learning Svelte.js and would like to rewrite our client side.

# Fun facts

- I fall a lot on my mountain bike.
- I chase my dog around the fields quite often because he likes rabbits.
- I try to keep a more organized source code than my own desk.
- I can navigate better in the woods than in the city.

# Some history

- My family background wasn't the best. That's why I think I wasn't a responsible student, and after high school I didn't have a proper goal and went to work as a waiter.

- After a year of slacking off, something changed in me and I started to have a desire to do something fulfilling. I started looking for a job in IT. A friend of mine just started
working as a tester and he praised it. I finally found a job as a tester and started working
for T-Mobile.

- I've always liked computers. In high school I was always interested in programming and testing was honestly not satisfying. I started to refresh my programming skills and look for
a new job.

- I managed to get a job in programming. My first projects were small plugins for Enterprise Architect. Eventually I got into web application development.

- Eventually I fall in love with software development and try to put all my free time into improving myself as a developer or as an athlete.
